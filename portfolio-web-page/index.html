      <!-- Second section as an about me to say my passion for web development and working well with others. Also talks about my hobbies outside of coding. -->
        <section id="about-me">
          <h3>About Steven</h3>
          <p>After moving down to San Diego to attend university, I got a job at Starbucks in 2014. After seven years of being a part of this amazing community, I realize that my true passion comes from creative problem solving to help those in need. This is where I got the idea to turn to Web Development, so that I may eventually work with a team of like-minded individuals to make the lives of others easier.</p>

          <p>Over the course of this year I have been working towards building an online community on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xc4oud">Twitch</a> in an effort to both entertain and teach things I have learned and to share my passion. Every time I stream I try to incorporate friends and family in an effort to bring attention to their stories and perspectives. I have projects in the works to highlight their unique voices and hope to give them a chance to represent themselves in ways they may not have had a chance to in the past.</p>

          <p>I am just starting out in my Web Development course, so there is still much to learn here at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>. As I continue to grow and learn, I plan to foster a community much like I have been a part of this last decade. Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me, and I would love for you to reach out if you have any questions or upcoming opportunities you would like to collaborate with me.</p>
